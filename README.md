# Ciao! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Stefano

### About Me
I'm a **Director of Software Engineering** at [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com). I prefer to think of myself as a **colleague**, an **engineer**, or simply a **geek**. I live and work in **Burgess Hill**, and you might catch me in **Brighton** or **London** probably for some tech event.

### What I'm Passionate About ðŸ”­
My passion extends beyond just my role at AmEx; I love exploring the realms of **technology**, **innovation**, and the **power of ideas**. I closely follow the **GraphQL community** and am an active member of the [UK GraphQL Community](https://graphql.org/community/). I'm fascinated by how good API design can transform applications and the impact of **Domain-Driven Design** on software architecture.

I enjoy discussing innovation publicly and believe in fostering a culture of creativity where groundbreaking ideas can thrive. Supporting others in their journeys from concept to prototype is something I find incredibly rewarding.

### Let's Chat ðŸ’¬
I'm always open to discussions about **data architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, the latest **tech trends**, and **innovation**. As an Italian, I bring a few cultural quirks to our conversations:
- **Straightforwardness**: I value transparency and communicate directly, which may come off as blunt.
- **Expressiveness**: Expect a passionate speaker who uses hand gestures to convey enthusiasm.
- **Focus**: My mind buzzes with ideas, and I might get sidetracked. If I interrupt, it's nothing personalâ€”just my way of engaging with urgency.

### How You Can Help ðŸ†˜
I'm happy to accept **PRs** and suggestions for any of my projects. If you're interested in onboarding into new activities or collaborating in any way, feel free to reach out! I'm always looking for ways we can help each other grow and contribute to our shared goals.

Also, consider giving back to the community. I try to contribute as much as I can.

### Fun Facts âš¡
Before 2019, I led a sedentary lifestyle and was overweight. A wake-up call from a medical aviation officer prompted me to transform my life. Over 18 months, I lost nearly **40 kilograms** and embraced running, clocking up around **8000km** since. In 2023, I completed over **1600km** and participated in **5 half-marathons**.

### Outside of Work ðŸ”Š
I keep busy with a few passions:
1. **Food**: Cooking daily meals is a joy for me, deeply rooted in my Italian heritage. I rarely order takeout and love to multitask while cooking. My favorite dish? _Risotto alla milanese_.
   
2. **Aviation**: I hold a pilot license and occasionally take colleagues on flights. While I had the chance to pursue a professional pilot career, I have no regrets about my choices.
   
3. **Traveling**: I enjoy immersing myself in diverse cultures rather than just beach vacations. My travels, especially in **Asia** and the **Middle East**, have enriched my understanding of the world. I also love exploring underwater as a **scuba diver**! ðŸ¤¿
